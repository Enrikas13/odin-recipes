   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
       <li>1 large russet potato</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon butter or margarine</li>
       <li>3 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
       <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
       <li>3 teaspoons sour cream</li>

   </ul>

   <h3>Steps</h3>

   <ol>
       <li>Scrub the potato, and prick several time with the tines of a fork. Place on a plate.</li>
       <li>Cook on full power in the microwave for <strong>5 minutes</strong>. Turn over, and continue to cook for <strong>5 more minutes.</strong> When the potato is soft, remove from the microwave, and cut in half lengthwise. Season with salt and pepper, and mash up the inside a little using a fork. Top the open sides with butter and 2 tablespoons of cheese. Return to the microwave, and cook for about <strong>1 minute</strong> to melt the cheese.</li>
       <li>Melt butter in a medium skillet over low heat. Gradually add flour, whisking until well combined. Slowly pour in milk, whisking constantly until smooth. Stir in cheeses, and cook over low heat until cheese is melted and the sauce is a little thick. Put macaroni in large casserole dish, and pour sauce over macaroni. Stir well.</li>
